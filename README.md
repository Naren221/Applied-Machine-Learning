## Note on Submission Dates
Assignment 1 was submitted on time as per the original deadline. However, due to a restructuring of the repository while setting up version control for Assignment 2, the original Git history for Assignment 1 was removed and reinitialized under a new root repository. As a result, the current Git commit history shows the submission date of Assignment 1 as the same as Assignment 2.The issue has been discussed with the professor.
